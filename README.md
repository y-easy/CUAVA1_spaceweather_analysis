This project examined associations between the orbital eccentricity of the CUAVA-1 cubesat and space weather as determined by F10.7xm, Kp, Dst and Ap indices.
Satellite orbital data was obtained from Celestrak (US Space Force) and space weather data from OMNIWeb Plus (NASA). Lomb-Scargle Periodograms and Cross-Correlations were used to determine periodicity similarity and time-delays between CUAVA-1 eccentricity and spaceweather fluctuations over the course of CUAVA-1's mission.
